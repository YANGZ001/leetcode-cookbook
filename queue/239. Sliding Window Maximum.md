[Sliding Window Maximum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

# Idea

Monotone queue.

Within sliding window of size `k`,  use a `monotone queue` to keep all the elements.

`Monotone queue` has the following properties:

1.   From head to tail, values are descending order, which means the head is the max number.
2.   For each new element, while it is bigger than the tail of queue, then remove the last. Then add current value into queue.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int m = n - k + 1;
        int[] res = new int[m];
        Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < n) {
            int cur = nums[r];
            r++;
            while (!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekLast() < cur) {
                dq.pollLast();
            }
            dq.offerLast(cur);
            while (r - l >= k) {
                res[l] = dq.peekFirst();
                int e = nums[l];
                if (dq.peekFirst() == e) dq.pollFirst();
                l++;
            }
            //System.out.printf("l = %d\n", l);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
