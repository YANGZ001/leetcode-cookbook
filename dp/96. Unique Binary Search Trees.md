[Unique Binary Search Trees - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

# Idea

Dynamic programming.

**Definition of dp**

`dp[i][j] means number of unique BSTs in during i,j`

**State Transfer Function**

`dp[i][j] += dp[i][k-1] * dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i,j+1);`

**Basic Case**

`if i > j, dp[i][j] = 1;`

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dp;
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        /* dynamic programming
        dp[i][j] means number of unique BSTs in during i,j
        dp[i][j] += dp[i][k-1] * dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i,j+1);
        base case: if i > j, dp[i][j] = 1;
        */
        dp = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return build(1,n);
    }
    public int build(int i, int j) {
        if (i > j) return 1;
        if (dp[i][j] != 0) return dp[i][j];
        for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
            int l = build(i, k-1);
            int r = build(k+1, j);
            dp[i][j] += l * r;
        }
        return dp[i][j];
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity

O(N^2) for n times calling of `build`, for each calling of `build`, time complexity is `O(N)`;

Space Complexity

O(N^2) for `dp`
