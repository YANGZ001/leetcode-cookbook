[Online Stock Span - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

# Idea

Use monotonic stack.

1.   The question asks how many items are there between current value and the value that is greater than current. This question can be solved by `monotonic stack`.
2.   We store each item's index and price as `new int[]{index, price}` into `stack`.
3.   For each price, while we find head of the stack is greater than current one, pop.
4.   Calculate result and push

# Code

```java
class StockSpanner {
    Deque<int[]> stk;
    int idx;
    public StockSpanner() {
        stk = new ArrayDeque<>();
        idx = -1;
        stk.offerLast(new int[]{idx, Integer.MAX_VALUE});
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        idx++;
        while (!stk.isEmpty() && price >= stk.peekLast()[1]) {
            stk.pollLast();
        }
        int res = idx - stk.peekLast()[0];
        stk.offerLast(new int[]{idx, price});
//        System.out.println(res);
        return res;
    }
}

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj.next(price);
 */
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**

`O(N)` where `N` is the times that `next(price)` is called. So we have `N` items of `price`, each `price` can only be pushed and popped once.

**Space Complexity**

`O(N)` for storing all the `N` prices into stack.
