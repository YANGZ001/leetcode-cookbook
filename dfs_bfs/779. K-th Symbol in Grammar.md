[K-th Symbol in Grammar - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/description/)

# Idea 1
n = 1, row = 0
n = 2, row = 01
n = 3, row = 0110
n = 4, row = 01100110
n = 5, row = 0110011001100110
For each row, it is previous row + reverse(previous row).
To solve this question, recursively call `kthGrammar`.
`1 << (n-1))` means number of items at current row, `1 << (n-2))` means mid point of current row.
If `k > 1 << (n-2))`, means we need to find it in previous row, with all the values reversed.
Else, we need to find in previous row with index = `k`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        if (k > (1 << (n-2))) return 1 ^ kthGrammar(n-1, k - (1 << (n-2)));
        return kthGrammar(n-1, k);
    }
}
```


# Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity**
`O(N)`
**Space Complexity**
`O(N)` for calling stacks.


# Idea 2
If we start from `0`, for each position, `2i` is the same as `i`, `2i+1` is the reverse of `i`.
Then, the question becomes to count the number of times we need to reverse, which is how many times `k` is a `odd` number, which becomes exactly number of bits of 1 in `k`.
# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        if (k > (1 << (n-2))) return 1 ^ kthGrammar(n-1, k - (1 << (n-2)));
        return kthGrammar(n-1, k);
    }
}
```


# Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity**
`O(logK)` for counting bits of 1 in `K`.
**Space Complexity**
`O(1)` for no extra space.
