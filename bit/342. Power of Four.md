[Power of Four - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/)

# Idea 1

Use `hashset` to calculate all the power of 4.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        if (n < 0) return false;
        Set<Integer> st = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i += 2) {
            st.add(1 << i);
        }
        return st.contains(n);
    }
}
```

# Idea 2

```tcl
For n to be a power of 4:
1. n > 0.
2. There is only one bit for n's binary representation.
3. The set bit of n should locate at even position.
```

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        if (n < 0) return false;
        // bit should be 1.
        // position should be even
        int cnt = 0;
        int pos = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if (((n >> i) & 1) != 0) {
                cnt++;
                pos = i;
            }
            if (cnt > 1) return false;
        }
        return (pos & 1) == 0;
    }
}

# Idea 3

```tcl
For n to be a power of 4:
1. n > 0.
2. There is only one bit for n's binary representation. (n & (n - 1)) is used to delete the lowest bit of n.
3. The set bit of n should locate at even position. 0x55555555 is 0b0101010101010101, used for ensure set bit in even location.
```

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        /*
        For n to be a power of 4:
        1. n > 0.
        2. There is only one bit for n's binary representation. (n & (n - 1)) is used to delete the lowest bit of n.
        3. The set bit of n should locate at even position. 0x55555555 is 0b0101010101010101, used for ensure set bit in even location.
        */
        return num > 0 && (num&(num-1)) == 0 && (num & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
}
```
