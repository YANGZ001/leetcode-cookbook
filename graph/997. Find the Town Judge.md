[Find the Town Judge - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

# Idea 1

Use a `fromcnt` and `cnt` array.

If `i` votes, `fromcnt[i]++`

if `j` gets a vote, `cnt[j]++`

In the end, if only one person get `n-1`vote, and this person has not voted. Then he is the judge. Else return -1.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        int[] cnt = new int[n + 1];
        int[] fromcnt = new int[n + 1];
        int max = 0;
        int maxCnt = 0;
        int id = -1;
        for (int[] t : trust) {
            int from = t[0];
            fromcnt[from]++;
            int to = t[1];
            cnt[to]++;
            if (max == cnt[to]) {
                maxCnt++;
            }
            if (max < cnt[to]) {
                max = cnt[to];
                maxCnt = 1;
                id = to;
            }
        }
        if (maxCnt != 1 || max != n - 1) return -1;
        return fromcnt[id] == 0 ? id : -1;
    }
}
```

# Idea 2

Think of each person as a `node` in graph. The judge should have `indegree - outdegree == n-1`

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] cnt = new int[n+1];
        for (int[] t : trust) {
            cnt[t[0]]--;// outdegree
            cnt[t[1]]++;// indegree
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (cnt[i] == n - 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
