[Possible Bipartition - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/description/)

# Idea

This is a question related to graph.

1.   We construct the graph using `Adjacent Matrix`. The relation is `undirected`. If `a` doesn't like `b`, then `a` and `b` cannot put together, so it is the same as `b` doesn't like `a`.
2.   We use `colors` array to assign `groups` to each person. Since we only need 2 groups, use `0` as unassigned, `1` as group 1, `-1` as group 2 is a good idea since we can easily flip the group by  `*(-1)`.
3.   For each person `i`, if `colors[i]==0`, which means this person has not been assigned a group, call `dfs(int[][] AM, int[] colors, int i, int color)` to assign person `i` to group `color`. If successfully, return true, else false.
4.   Within the `dfs` function, we try to assign each of the people person `i` doesn't like. If assign successfully for every one, then return true, else false.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean possibleBipartition(int n, int[][] dislikes) {
        int[][] AM = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] dis : dislikes) {
            int f = dis[0] - 1;
            int t = dis[1] - 1;
            AM[f][t] = 1;
            AM[t][f] = 1;
        }
        int[] colors = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0 && !dfs(AM, colors, i, 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean dfs(int[][] AM, int[] colors, int i, int color) {
        int n = AM.length;
        colors[i] = color; // assign color to i;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (AM[i][j] == 1) {
                if (colors[j] == color) return false;
                if (colors[j] == 0 && !dfs(AM, colors, j, -1*color)) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**

`O(V+E)`, where `V` is the number of vertex, `E` is number of edges. Since `O(V) = O(N)` and `O(E) = O(N^2)`, time complexity is `O(N^2)`. 

**Space Complexity**

`O(N^2 + N)`. `O(N^2)` for `Adjacent Matrix`, `O(N)` for `colors` array.
