[Linked List Cycle II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

# Idea

Fast/slow pointers. Fast pointer go twice the distance than that of slow pointer. If cycle exists, fast and slow will meet each other. Let's assume 5 variable. 

1. Distance of slow : s.
2. Distance of fast : f.
3. From head to where cycle begins is x. 
4. From x to where two pointer meets is y. 
5. And the length of cycle is r.

We can have these equation:

1. `f = 2 * s`
2. `s = x + y`
3. `f - s = n * r`

Combined to get: `x + y = n * r` which equals to `x = n*r - y`

In order to get `x`, which is `n*r - y`, let a new node go from head and slow go next, while they meet, it is where the cycle begins.

# Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return null;
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (fast == slow) break;
        }
        if (fast.next == null || fast.next.next  == null) return null;
        ListNode p = head;
        while (p != slow) {
            p = p.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return p;
    }
}
```
