[Maximum Performance of a Team - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-performance-of-a-team/)

# Idea

Max performance is obtained by `min(efficiency) * sum(speed)`.

1.   Sort the array by `efficiency` decreasingly. Therefore, we are guaranteed to get the smallest efficiency during one loop.
2.   Use `priority Queue ` to keep track the smallest speed during the selected. If `queue.size() > k`, means we need to poll the engineer with the least speed.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    int MOD = 1000_000_000 + 7;
    public int maxPerformance(int n, int[] speed, int[] efficiency, int k) {
        int[][] nums = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums[i][0] = efficiency[i];
            nums[i][1] = speed[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums, (a, b) -> b[0]-a[0]); // sort by efficiency decreasingly
        Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        long max = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        for (int[] i : nums) {
            sum += i[1];
            pq.offer(i[1]);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                sum -= pq.poll(); // poll the least speed
            }
            // i[0] is guaranteed to be the smallest efficiency
            max = Math.max(max, sum * i[0]);
        }
        return (int) (max % MOD);
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**

O(N*logN) for sorting.

**Space Complexity**

O(N) for creating a new 2D array.
