[Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/description/)

# Idea

Use two pointers `l` and `r` to denote `left` position and `right` position.

For a substring with the same color, `l` is the start position(inclusive), `r` is the end position (exclusive).

What needs us to do is find the `sum` and `max` from the substring `(l,r)`, and `sum - max` is the minimum value we need.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = colors.length();
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < n) {
            int curSum = 0;
            int curMaxTime = 0;
            while (r < n && colors.charAt(r) == colors.charAt(l)) {
                curSum += neededTime[r];
                curMaxTime = Math.max(curMaxTime, neededTime[r]);
                r++;
            }
            // r != l
            res += curSum - curMaxTime;
            l = r;
        } 
        return res;
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**

`O(N)` for every char would only be traversed once.

**Space Complexity**

`O(1)`
