[Boats to Save People - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

# Idea

Each boat can only takes up to 2 people.

In this case, we sort `people` increasingly.

We maintain 2 pointer `l` and `r`. Then for each boat, firstly we load a big weight person, whose weight is `people[r++]`. We then check whether the most light-weighted person can be loaded, if could, `l++`. 

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int n = people.length;
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (l <= r) {
            cnt++;
            int cur = 0;
            // big
            if (l <= r && cur + people[r] <= limit) {
                cur += people[r];
                r--;
            }
            // small
            if (l <= r && cur + people[l] <= limit) {
                cur += people[l];
                l++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
